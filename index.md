# Hi, I'm Urban Etter

This is a collection of some experiments, unfinished side projects and some written down thoughts. Most of the stuff has something to do with programming.

# p5js
Some more recent stuff. I love the simplicity and visuality of p5js. Here are some experiments I did with it:

## maze gernerator, a* path finder implementation
Click in the grid for setting a start point, then a grid gets generated. A second click sets the target for the A* path find algorithm.

* [Demo](p5js/maze)
* [p5.js Editor sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/urban/sketches/1V9ImiKsw)

# artificial jass intelligence
It started with an experiment, how much effort it would take to teach a computer to play Jass, a Swiss card game. Like a lot of side projects, this project is completed about 80%. But I keep coming back to it every 6 to 12 month or so, so I might finish it at soem point....

## blog posts
Back in the days when I wanted to start a blog I actually wrote some posts about software engineering stuff. Here they are.
