## Hi

This is a collection of some experiments, unfinished side projects and some written down thoughts. Most of the stuff has something to do with programming.

## p5js
Some more recent stuff. I love the simplicity and visuality of p5js. Here are some experiments I did with it:

* [A maze generator, including a A* path finder implementation](p5js/maze)

## artificial jass intelligence
It started with an experiment, how much effort it would take to teach a computer to play Jass, a Swiss card game. Like a lot of side projects, this project is completed about 80%. But I keep coming back to it every 6 to 12 month or so, so I might finish it at soem point....

## blog posts
Back in the days when I wanted to start a blog I actually wrote some posts about software engineering stuff. Here they are.
